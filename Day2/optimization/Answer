matmut.py
Line27: result[i][j] += X[i][k] * Y[k][j] take around 86% of the total time (3s)



euler72.py (increased number of primes for better Profiling)
80% is from:
21 -> Factorize
with the highest contribution by: Line29: if(p > sqrt(n)):


20% is from:
50 -> fast_phi






After optimization of matmut.py:
Reduced time from 3s -> 131ms 
Most time is consumed by import of numpy
